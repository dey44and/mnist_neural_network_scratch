# MNIST dataset digit recognizer from scratch

## 1. Introduction

I was interested to create a simple feedforward neural network from scratch, using only Linear Algebra and a simple GUI using PyQT.
</br></br>
All dependencies used to realize this project are specified in _requirements.txt_ file. To train the model and to create a flow of execution, I used **Jupyter Notebook**.
<br></br>
The GUI was created using _QT Designer_ and saved as an _.ui_ file. To draw the digit that will be recognized, I added the canvas in the code section and I use mouse events to draw the digit.

## 2. The architecture of Neural Network and the dataset

## 3. Results and future improvements

## 4. Final considerations
